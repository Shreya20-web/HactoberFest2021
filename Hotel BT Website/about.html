                <p>It was a lovely stay. The room was very spacious 
                    and hygienic, full of amenities. There was no 
                    compromise in the food quality and the staff 
                    was very cooperative. Would love to visit again! 
                    Everything was amazing. Room was bang on, buffet 
                    services were really good and food was great ! 
                    Had breakfast, lunch and dinner - all buffet. 
                    Evening buffet at NYC can be improved, apart 
                    from it I loved my stay. Must visit</p>
